#### Graph Representation Learning

This library is an unstable, untested and poorly documented bunch of hacks I write for my PhD. Don't use it. 
I publish it only to make it easier for some folks to reproduce my Jupyter notebooks.

#### INSTALLATION

```bash
$ bash INSTALL.sh
```

Note: this will ask you for sudo password, as Grl needs to remount `/tmp` in memory
to function properly.

#### DOCUMENTATION

To build the documentation do: 
```bash
$ cd docs && make html
```
