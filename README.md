#### Graph Representation Learning

---

#### TODO
- [x] Conversions between three formats: igraph, adjacency, native.
- [ ] Orthogonalization of simple embeddings. 
- [ ] Global link prediction heuristics. 
- [ ] Sphinx docstrings.
- [ ] List reasons to use 1-indexing.  

---

Other stuff;
* Functions defined in `graph.core` are exported at the module level. 
* I try to mark places where conversions between 1- and 0- indexing are taking place with a `@1-indexing` comment.
