#### TODO
- [ ] add full matrix reconstruction tests for symmetric and diagonal models.  
- [ ] diagonal model is 2x slower than symmetric and asymmetric. investigate.  
- [ ] loss/metrics monitoring during training. Automatic stopping.
- [ ] Adam optimizer. 
- [ ] Online evaluation + checkpointing for training larger graphs. 
- [ ] add/remove edges
- [ ] Orthogonalization of simple embeddings. 
- [ ] List reasons to use 1-indexing: padding, missing data. 
- [ ] grl vs tf benchmarks.
- [ ] learning rate & number of steps conditional on graph size/density.
- [ ] Built-in real-world datasets.
