Scaling:
- [ ] Evaluation on graphs too large to build adjacency matrix.

Embedding methods:
- [ ] Orthogonalization of simple embeddings. 
- [ ] Global link prediction heuristics. 

Functionality:
- [ ] add/remove edges

Performance:
- [ ] `graph.utils.to_igraph` is too slow.  
- [ ] `jobs/performance-tuning`:
    - [ ] learning rate
    - [ ] describe tensorflow benchmarks
